# KQL

Kusto Query Language is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It assumes a relational data model of tables and columns with a minimal set of data types. The language is very expressive, easy to read and understand the query intent, and optimized for authoring experiences. The Kusto Query Language is optimal for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs with deep support for text search and parsing, time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs that provide the optimal language for data analysis.
