# DC SYSVOL and AD Replication Health Monitor

## Intro
This package publishes a Microsoft Sentinel / Azure Monitor workbook for Domain Controller replication health from a sysadmin and security operations perspective. Using the XPath: DFS Replication!* , File Replication Service!*, Directory Service!*

It is built for day-1 operations with:
- Environment-wide replication KPIs
- DFSR and NTFRS deep-dive troubleshooting views
- Directory Service replication and DNS dependency analysis
- Cross-source critical event triage
- Per-DC health scoring and silent host detection
- Log volume and cost estimation

## Summary For Sysadmin And Security
This workbook gives sysadmin and security teams fast triage coverage for replication-impacting issues, clear visibility into risk concentration, and practical operational trends for remediation.

- Find failing DCs quickly, prioritize highest-impact replication faults, and track recovery.
- Understand replication risk posture, affected scope, and sustained stability trends.

### Tab Breakdown
| Tab | Sysadmin And Security Use |
|---|---|
| Overview | Validate whether replication telemetry is healthy and complete across all DCs, and review high-level health and severity posture in one view. |
| DFS Replication | Investigate DFSR stoppage, out-of-sync conditions, and service disruption patterns while tracking concentration of critical DFSR conditions over time. |
| File Replication (NTFRS) | Triage journal wrap, SYSVOL not-ready state, and partner connectivity faults while assessing residual NTFRS risk in legacy or mixed environments. |
| Directory Service | Investigate AD replication failures, KCC topology issues, and DNS-linked faults while monitoring enterprise directory health risk. |
| Security and MDE | Correlate focus event IDs with SecurityEvent, MDE, and Arc operational signals to measure telemetry breadth for DC assets. |
| Critical Events | Prioritize multi-source failures and highest-severity events for immediate action while tracking systemic risk across replication subsystems. |
| DC Health Matrix | Score each DC by subsystem health and identify silent or degraded systems quickly while reviewing enterprise-wide health distribution and outliers. |
| Log Volume and Cost | Estimate billed volume trends and projected 30-day cost by source and host to forecast cost exposure and optimize telemetry investment. |

## Section Details And What Each One Does

### Overview
- What it does: provides enterprise-level KPI and trend snapshots across DFS Replication, File Replication Service, and Directory Service logs.
- Primary visuals: KPI tiles, event volume timeline, source distribution, severity mix, top DC summary.
- Why it matters: confirms collection coverage and quickly identifies whether replication risk is rising or isolated.

### DFS Replication
- What it does: focuses on DFSR-specific replication failures and service health indicators.
- Primary visuals: critical event ID trends, top impacted DCs, service stop/start/halt timelines, detailed recent error table.
- Why it matters: catches 2213/4012/5002/6016 class failures that can interrupt SYSVOL consistency.

### File Replication (NTFRS)
- What it does: tracks NTFRS health for legacy or transitional environments still relying on FRS behavior.
- Primary visuals: journal wrap and SYSVOL readiness indicators, partner connectivity patterns, critical event reference.
- Why it matters: identifies SYSVOL readiness and partner replication risk where NTFRS is still present.

### Directory Service
- What it does: analyzes AD replication and topology health from Directory Service events.
- Primary visuals: AD replication event distributions, DNS failure breakdown (2087/2088), replication failure detail by DC.
- Why it matters: surfaces isolated DCs, KCC path failures, and directory-level replication integrity risk.

### Security and MDE
- What it does: combines high-priority replication event IDs with SecurityEvent, MDE operational signals, and Arc heartbeat visibility.
- Primary visuals: focus event KPI set, source trend comparisons, DC signal summary for network/process/logon activity.
- Why it matters: gives sysadmin and security teams a cross-domain operational view for correlation and faster triage decisions.

### Critical Events
- What it does: unifies critical and error-level events across all three replication data sources.
- Primary visuals: cross-source timeline, source-stacked error distribution, multi-source impact table, full detail feed.
- Why it matters: prioritizes systems failing in multiple subsystems where business impact is highest.

### DC Health Matrix
- What it does: produces a per-DC scorecard across DFSR, NTFRS, and Directory Service with an overall health state.
- Primary visuals: scorecard table, stacked error totals, hourly error-rate summary, silent DC detection.
- Why it matters: supports daily operational review and helps teams rank remediation by measurable risk.

### Log Volume and Cost
- What it does: estimates ingestion and cost from billed-size telemetry for workbook-covered events.
- Primary visuals: KPI tiles, daily billed trend, by-source volume/cost, per-device 30-day projection.
- Why it matters: ties operational telemetry value to spend so teams can optimize signal quality and budget.
