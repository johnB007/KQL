//Is it possible to collect start time, execution process, written file name using Advanced hunting function when writing data to USB memory or CD/DVD on WDATP onboard machine?
//Advanced hunting does have FileCreationEvents, but there isn't anything in that table that determines if the FolderPath is a USB, CD/DVD, or hard drive.  FolderPath consists of a drive letter and file path.  For example:

FileCreationEvents
| where FolderPath startswith "d"

// Another way might be to query the registry keys.

RegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey contains "MountedDevices"
