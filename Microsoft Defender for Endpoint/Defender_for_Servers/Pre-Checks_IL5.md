## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Overview

This guide enables migration from Trellix to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on Windows Servers in DoD (IL5/USGovDoD) environments using a **two-phase approach**:

* **Phase A:** Deploy MDE in EDR Block mode alongside Trellix (coexistence)
* **Phase B:** Transition MDAV to Active mode and disable Trellix

 **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - Tamper Protection:**  
Once Tamper Protection is enabled and MDAV switches to Active mode (Phase B), it **CANNOT** be switched back to Phase A (EDR Block mode) on platform version 4.18.2208.0+. Phase B is a **one-way transition**. Ensure thorough testing before broad deployment.

## 2. PREREQUISITES

### 2.1 Network Requirements &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#0078D4; font-size:0.85em;"> **Verification:** Run `OCE.exe -EnvironmentName "USGovDoD"`</span>

#### DoD MDE Endpoints (Streamlined Connectivity - Preview)

 **Preview Status:** Streamlined connectivity is in PREVIEW for US Government. Fully patch Windows Servers before onboarding.

**Applies to:** Windows Server 2019/2022/2025 and Windows Server 2016/2012 R2 with modern unified solution  
**Legacy/MMA:** If any 2012 R2/2016 servers remain on legacy/MMA, also allow standard connectivity list

**Important:** Streamlined connectivity reduces MDE service endpoints but does NOT eliminate dependencies for portal access, onboarding, identity, Live Response, and certificate validation.

 **CRITICAL - Commercial (.com/.net) Endpoints Required for DoD:**  
The following `.com`/`.net` endpoints are **REQUIRED** by Microsoft even for IL5 DoD environments and **CANNOT** be substituted with `.us`/`.mil` equivalents:
* **Certificate Revocation/Validation** (`crl.microsoft.com`, `ctldl.windowsupdate.com`, `www.microsoft.com/pkiops/*`, `www.microsoft.com/pki/certs`) - Required by Windows OS for SSL/TLS certificate trust validation
* **Live Response** (`*.wns.windows.com`, `login.live.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`) - Required for Live Response functionality

**Minimum Required Endpoints (Core MDE Functionality):**

#### Connectivity Validation

* ☐ **Firewall rules configured** for all MDE endpoints (above)
* ☐ **Firewall rules configured** for all Azure Arc endpoints (above, if using Defender for Servers Plan 2)
* ☐ **Proxy configuration tested** (if applicable)

* ☐ **Run MDE Connectivity Analyzer** on each server type to verify all endpoints are accessible
  * Available from MDE Portal settings or Azure Arc guest configuration
  * Verify all critical endpoints return successful connectivity

## 3. System Configuration & Policy Validation

**Complete this validation before starting any deployment:**

### 3.1 System & Configuration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#0078D4; font-size:0.85em;"> **Validation:**

#### Third-Party EPP Configuration

* ☐ **Third-Party EPP Exceptions**: Configure HBSS/Trellix/Tanium to exclude Microsoft Defender processes
  * Download the MDE connectivity URL list from Microsoft Learn (US Gov): `https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/standard-device-connectivity-urls-gov`
  * Review Microsoft Defender Processes tab
  * Ensure all required Microsoft Defender binaries are excluded from third-party EPP scanning
  * Without these exclusions, conflicts will occur during Phase A coexistence (EDR Block mode)

#### GPO Deployment

* ☐ **Deploy MDE Configuration GPOs** (from DoD HBSS Divestment folder):
  * MDE – Configurations GPO - Computer
  * MDE – MDAV Trellix Exclusions GPO - Computer
  * MDE – MDAV Tanium Exclusions GPO - Computer (if applicable)
  * MDE – Device Control - Computer
  
  **Verify GPO applied:**
  ```powershell
  gpresult /scope:computer /h C:\gpreport.html
  # Verify MDE and exclusion GPOs appear in Applied Group Policy Objects
  ```

* ☐ **Modify MDE – Configurations GPO settings:**
  * Modify proxy settings if applicable (Set to Not Configured if not using proxy)
  * Modify telemetry settings: Configure Connected User Experiences and Telemetry (Set to Not Configured if not using proxy)
  * For Server 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019: MDAV will be in Passive Mode until Trellix is removed. Update GPP after Trellix uninstall to delete the registry entry.
  * Update organization-specific contact information in Windows Security Enterprise Customizations

* ☐ **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules** (configured in MDE – Configurations GPO):
  * Review configured rules; keep higher impact rules in audit mode initially
  * Recommended audit period: 30-60 days before enabling block enforcement

* ☐ **Deploy Current STIGs** for all target servers: Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, 2025 (as applicable), plus Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Windows Firewall STIGs

* ☐ **Review Advanced Settings in MDE Portal** with the Federal MDE Pursuit Team before broad onboarding:
  * Create device groups for customer before onboarding
  * Review automation rules and alert thresholds
  * Verify ASR rule audit data collection is configured

#### Platform Version, Updates & Service Status

* ☐ **Windows Defender feature check** (Server 2016 and 2019+):
  ```powershell
  Get-WindowsFeature -name Windows-Defender
  Add-WindowsFeature -name Windows-Defender -includeallsubfeature
  ```

* ☐ **Windows Defender service present and running**
  ```powershell
  Get-Service -Name WinDefend
  Start-Service -Name WinDefend
  Set-Service -Name WinDefend -StartupType Automatic
  ```

* ☐ **Verify Windows Defender components are current:**
  ```powershell
  Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object AMProductVersion
  Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object AMEngineVersion
  Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object AntivirusSignatureVersion, AntivirusSignatureLastUpdated
  ```

* ☐ **Deploy Required Updates (Apply in sequence):**
  1. **Security Intelligence Update (SIU)** - Target all Windows Servers
     * Download: `http://aka.ms/siu64` or KB2267602
  2. **Platform Update (KB4052623)** - Target all Windows Servers
  3. **Sense EDR Update (KB5005292)** - Target only Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 with Unified agent
  
  **Action:** Update via Windows Update/WSUS if versions are outdated. Reboot after each update before proceeding.
  
  * Verify updates applied:
    ```powershell
    Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object AMProductVersion, AMEngineVersion, AntivirusSignatureVersion
    ```

### 3.2 Policy & Registry Validation

**Review and validate policy settings that may have disabled Windows Defender for third-party EPP/EDR.**

#### Registry & Policy Configuration

* ☐ **Verify Defender disablement policies are NOT present**
  * `DisableAntiSpyware`, `DisableRealtimeMonitoring`, and `DisableBehaviorMonitoring` should be absent
  * Group Policy: Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Microsoft Defender Antivirus → Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus = "Not Configured"

* ☐ **Run Group Policy Report**
  ```powershell
  gpresult /H C:\gpreport.html
  ```

#### Group Policy Review - Common Defender Disablement Policies

**Review these common Group Policy settings that may have disabled Windows Defender for third-party EDR/AV:**

| GPO Setting | Path | Impact | Action |
|-------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender → Real-time Protection` | Disables MDAV entirely | Must be removed or set to "Not Configured" |
| **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender Firewall` | Disables Defender Firewall | Review if needed for Phase A/B |
| **Disable periodic scanning** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender → Scan` | Disables signature updates | Must be removed for Phase A/B |
| **Disable real-time monitoring** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender → Real-time Protection` | Disables real-time scanning | Must be removed for Phase A/B |
| **Disable behavior monitoring** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender → Real-time Protection` | Disables behavioral detection | Must be removed for EDR Block/MDAV Active mode |
| **Allow antivirus to be disabled** | `Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Defender → Real-time Protection` | Permits disabling MDAV | Verify setting to prevent accidental disable |

**Action Required:**

* ☐ Review Group Policy Editor: `gpedit.msc` (or GPMC if domain-joined)
  ```powershell
  # Open Group Policy Editor
  gpedit.msc
  # Navigate to: Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows Defender
  ```
* ☐ Check `Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows Defender`
* ☐ Verify no policies are forcing Defender OFF
* ☐ If domain-joined, check domain GPOs as well (using GPMC)
  ```powershell
  # Generate Active Directory Group Policy report
  gpresult /scope:computer /h C:\gpreport_domain.html
  # Review for conflicting Windows Defender policies
  ```
* ☐ Document any Defender-disabling policies that must be modified before Phase A

**Important:** Do NOT disable Windows Defender Firewall if it's the primary firewall protection. Only disable if third-party firewall solution is managing network protection.

### 3.3 Exclusions Configuration

* ☐ Trellix exclusions configured for MDAV/MDE binaries

* ☐ MDAV exclusions ready to apply for Trellix binaries

### 3.4 Pre-Flight Summary

* ☐ **All critical checks passed?**
  * All registry validations successful
  * All GPO deployments verified applied
  * All updates installed and verified
  * All firewall rules configured
  * All endpoint connectivity tests successful
  * All exclusions configured
  * All STIGs deployed

## 11. Field Gocthas from Previous Deployments

Use this section as a final go/no-go check before broad deployment.

### Common Gotchas to Validate

* ☐ **TLS trust chain is complete**
  * Confirm required root/intermediate CAs are present in the local computer trust stores.
  * Missing trust anchors can cause onboarding, portal sign-in, and update failures even when DNS/TCP checks pass.

* ☐ **CRL/OCSP checks pass**
  * Validate certificate revocation reachability (CRL/OCSP) from each server subnet.
  * If these are blocked, TLS validation failures may appear as intermittent connectivity issues.

* ☐ **Proxy inspection is not breaking Defender traffic**
  * If SSL inspection is enabled, verify Defender endpoints are excluded where required.
  * Confirm the proxy does not rewrite certificates for critical Defender service URLs.

* ☐ **Third-party EDR self-protection/tamper controls are planned**
  * Confirm approved maintenance-window procedure for Trellix policy relaxation or uninstall sequence.
  * Ensure rollback owner and escalation path are documented before cutover.

* ☐ **Mutual exclusions are verified both ways**
  * Validate Trellix exclusions for Defender binaries.
  * Validate Defender exclusions for Trellix binaries during coexistence window.

* ☐ **Defender policy conflicts are source-traced**
  * Capture GPO name and link path for any setting forcing Defender off.
  * Do not proceed until conflicting domain/local policies are remediated.

* ☐ **Service baseline is healthy before onboarding**
  * `WinDefend` and `Sense` services running; platform/engine/signatures current
  * Passive Mode registry entries present for Server 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019 (transition to Active Mode after Trellix removal)

* ☐ **MDE Portal Advanced Settings are reviewed and aligned**
  * Device groups created; automation/remediation rules set; ASR audit data collecting

* ☐ **Onboarding timing expectations are communicated**
  * Define expected time for device appearance and health status in the Defender portal
  * Document who to contact if portal registration exceeds SLA

* ☐ **Pilot exit criteria are explicit**
  * No app-impact regressions observed.
  * Detection telemetry present and stable.
  * CPU/memory utilization within agreed bounds.

* ☐ **Post-cutover drift checks are scheduled**
  * Weekly review for stale signatures, offboarded devices, broken telemetry, and policy drift.
