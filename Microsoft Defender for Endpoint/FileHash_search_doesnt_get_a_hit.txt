A:
If you see telemetry in the file profile page, so I assume it’s from another event – maybe a WDAV or exploit guard event (in which case you should query MiscEvents table)? Maye it’s a process create event (query ProcessCreationEvents table)?
You can use this query to query on a file SHA1 on all tables at once:
https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsDefenderATP-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/General%20queries/File%20footprint.txt

What is the SHA1 you see in the advanced hunting query you ran?
I assume it’s empty, and hence your query on SHA1 doesn’t find it…
We sometimes don’t get the file details such as hash reported, especially in file create events (e.g. if it was quickly removed or remediated before we got to scan it).
This was more common in older OS versions.
The demo data is quite stale and hacky (AFAIK it has undergone some manual tweaks at the time), and I don’t think it’s worth investigating issues with this data, but you could always send a frownie and maybe it’ll be further investigated or approved when triaged (please remember to include your real email address, and not the demo tenant user).
