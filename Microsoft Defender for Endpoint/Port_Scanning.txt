//We recently shipped two port scan detectors:

VerticalPortScanInitiated IoA ID: 0eadf7a9-d1d2-425e-91c3-e191e388c38f – for monitoring vertical port scanning 
HorizontalPortScanInitiated IoA ID: 31aa78a0-a428-4eb4-8dcc-85ff71ba659c – for monitoring horizontal port scanning 

These IoAs  are behavioral anomaly detectors and tool-name-agnostic, capturing distinct tools with aggressive port scanning behaviors including nmap, nmap.exe 
and even general tools (e.g., javaw.exe is also used for port scanning). 

See the table below.  Please note the detection depends upon the intensity/aggressiveness of port scanning over a certain threshold, so low and slow behaviors may not fire (if we made this more sensitive, we would have too many false positives).
