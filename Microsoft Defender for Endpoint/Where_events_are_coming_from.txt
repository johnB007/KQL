//wanted to understand which events are coming from WD AV, which events are coming from EDR, which events are coming from ExploitGuard etc.

//If they query from MiscEvents table, they can filter on ActionType startswith "Antivirus" to get all AV events, and ActionType startswith "ExploitGuard" for all ExploitGuard events.

MiscEvents
| where MachineId == "3c5ed1afeec3bbac99beaa4ad2dfce941488b115" and ActionType startswith "Antivirus" 
 
If they want to get all other events, they could do this:
find in (FileCreationEvents, ProcessCreationEvents, MiscEvents, RegistryEvents, NetworkCommunicationEvents, ImageLoadEvents)
where MachineId == "3c5ed1afeec3bbac99beaa4ad2dfce941488b115"
and EventTime between (datetime(2018-07-09T17:19) .. 1h)
and ActionType !startswith "Antivirus" and ActionType !startswith "ExploitGuard"
| limit 1000
